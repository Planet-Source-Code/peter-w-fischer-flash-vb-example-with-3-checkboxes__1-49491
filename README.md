### Description

VB might be one of the greatest tools for fast programming but - the user interface! isn't it at least a little clumpsy and boring? But there ist help, called macromedia flash! I think much mor coders would like to use flash-movies for the user-end but ... isn't it a pain to handle the inteface? NO IT ISN'T ans it's worth to become familiar to it!
 
### More Info
 
you need of course the actual flash.ocx to get the movie run! look for the newest flash-playler on macromedia.com and install the FREE player. the OCX will be there...

of course, one must dive a little into the action-script language of flash, but it's rather close to VB (except little but disturbing diffeences like i.e. the double == for logical comparisons). Again: it's worth to spend some time on it!
